👋 Hi, I’m Tauhid, 📊 On a mission to engineer data ecosystems that turn information into intelligence. 🧠 I make data flow, systems scale, and pipelines behave.

🚀 About Me :~
🔹 Data Engineering & Big Data Enthusiast | 🔹 Experienced Android Developer | 🔹 Tech Explorer & Problem-Solver

🌱 **Currently Exploring**:
Building scalable data pipelines for efficient ETL workflows :- 
Leveraging Apache Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Databricks, Docker, Data Build Tool(DBT), Hadoop(HDFS)/Hive(beeline), Snowflake, Promethus/Grafana MySQL, PostgreSQL and NoSQL(MongoDB) databases to process massive datasets.
Exploring Cloud-based solutions Microsoft(Azure) for data storage, processing, and analytics.
Strengthening skills in Python, Pandas, Pyspark, Numpy, SQL, and distributed computing.
Machine Learning :- Trains machine learning models (Isolation Forest(scikit-learn), Autoencoder with PyTorch/TensorFlow, TensorDataset) | ML Ops.
Matplotlib, Numpy (exploration & visualization), MLflow. 

📱 **Android Development Expertise**:
Extensive experience in Native Android Development (Kotlin/Java)
Strong foundation in MVVM architecture, Jetpack Components, UI/UX optimization, and API integrations
Passionate about crafting efficient, scalable, and high-performance mobile applications.

🔍 **Past Experience**:
