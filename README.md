👋 Hi, I’m Tauhid, 📊 On a mission to engineer data ecosystems that turn information into intelligence. I make data flow, systems scale, and pipelines behave.

🌐 About Me :~
 Data Engineering & Big Data Enthusiast | Tech Explorer & Problem-Solver.

🌱 **Currently Exploring**:
Building scalable data pipelines for efficient ETL workflows :- 
Leveraging Apache Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Databricks, Docker, Data Build Tool(DBT), Hadoop(HDFS)/Hive(beeline), Snowflake, Promethus/Grafana MySQL, PostgreSQL and NoSQL(MongoDB) databases to process massive datasets.
Exploring Cloud-based solutions Microsoft(Azure) for data storage, processing, and analytics.
Strengthening skills in Python, Pandas, Pyspark, Numpy, SQL, and distributed computing.
Machine Learning :- Trains machine learning models (Isolation Forest(scikit-learn), Autoencoder with PyTorch/TensorFlow, TensorDataset) | ML Ops.
Matplotlib, Numpy (exploration & visualization), MLflow. 

**Past Experience**:
Android Development Expertise: Extensive experience in Native Android Development (Kotlin/Java). Strong foundation in MVVM architecture, Jetpack Components, UI/UX optimization, and API integrations, driven about crafting efficient, scalable, and high-performance mobile applications.

Worked on Web3.0 & Ethereum Blockchain projects in my b.tech final years, designing and deploying smart contracts using Solidity, Developed decentralized applications (DApps) and explored blockchain integrations, 'Passionate about emerging technologies and their real-world impact'.

💡 **Looking to Collaborate On**:
